# Forkify
Recipe searching app using the Food2Fork API.

This is a project that I made during the Udemy course called 'The Complete JavaScript 2019: Build Real Projects!' by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The app is powered by the Food2Fork API, and since it only offers 50 free calls per day, it's use is extremely limited.
Not intended for production use, I just only want to show it in my portfolio.

# Forkify
Recipe searching app using the Food2Fork API.

This is a project that I made during the Udemy course called 'The Complete JavaScript 2019: Build Real Projects!' by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The app is powered by the Food2Fork API, and since it only offers 50 free calls per day, it's use is extremely limited.

It features technologies like:
- ES6 syntax
- asnyc/await
- fetching data from an API
- MVC (model-view-controller)
- Webpack
- Babel
- NPM
- Axios
- local storage


Demo to the app: https://nemesmatyas.github.io/Forkify



Not intended for production use, I just only want to show it in my portfolio.

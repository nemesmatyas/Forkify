# Forkify
Recipe searching app using the Food2Fork API.

## API shut down, so needs refactoring

It features technologies like:
- ES6 syntax
- asnyc/await
- fetching data from an API
- MVC (model-view-controller)
- Webpack
- Babel
- NPM
- Axios
- local storage


Demo to the app: https://nemesmatyas.github.io/Forkify



Not intended for production use, I just only want to show it in my portfolio.
